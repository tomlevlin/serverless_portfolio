        This portfolio showcases some of my serverless sites, including this portfolio itself which is also built on the serverless framework. </br>
        The site is hosted in a AWS S3 bucket and it is integrated with Github. With some help from a AWS Lambda script the site uses AWS CodeDeploy and CodePipeline for automatic deployments.

        I started my career with computers as a little boy, I remember getting my first PC as a christmas gift from my parents when I was about 10 years old. This was to be the beginning of a long career within the ICT sector. </br></br>

        I studied to become and B.Sc. in information technology and landed my first IT job (Jobline Oy) while studying. The job started out by translating a swedish webiste to Finnish, but quickly my manager noticed that I was fully capable of running all kind of other IT related stuff as well so he promoted me to the post of IT-Manager and I took responsibility for the IT department.  </br></br>

        4 years later I moved to MTV Oy where I spent 11 years doing all kind of interesting things. At the beginning I was responsible for the technical side of the teletext services that were running on three different TV-channels. However my boss at that time took me along for an interesting "small project", a reality show called BigBrother. He had been chosen to build up the interactive part of this program which involved streaming live online video 24/7 for the duration of the 96 day show. We also needed to build up an environment where our reporters would sit and write their news stories online. The first year of the show was a great success and we ended up doing 10 seasons of the show and I ended up doing the last 5 seasons by myself. In 2012 I was moved over to the Infrastructure team where I then quickly became responsible for the virtualization- and storage infrastructures. </br>

        So where am I today? </br></br>

        Today I live in Spain where I started my own consultant agency in 2015. The previous year I have also been studying to become an expert on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud services, the goal is to have all the AWS certificates at some point. </br></br>


        Specialties: </br>
         - AWS </br>
         - IT-infrastructure (Servers hardware, Virtualization &amp; Storage)</br>
         - VMware vSphere </br>
         - Hitachi Storage solutions </br>
         - Sysmedia - Plasma3 Teletext systems </br>
         - Linux (CentOS, RedHat, Ubuntu) </br>
         - Windows Server admin </br></br></br>

         Please feel free to contact me if you have any project where you might need help.
